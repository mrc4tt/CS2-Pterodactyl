## Tips

- Running CS:GO post-CS2 launch will cause the server to constantly spam that it needs an update, you can use the [Cleaner SourceMod extension](https://github.com/accelerator74/Cleaner/tree/master) to get rid of these messages if they're annoying. Edit `addons/sourcemod/configs/cleaner.cfg` and add the following<sup>[#2](https://github.com/1zc/CS2-Pterodactyl/issues/2)</sup>:
  ```
  MasterRequestRestart
  Your server needs to be restarted in order to receive the latest update.
  ```
